## 1. Project title. 

Spam Classifier

## 2. What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?

Spambase Dataset: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&status=active&qualities.NumberOfInstances=between_1000_10000&id=44

## 3. Description of the problem you’ll solve. 

Use the Spambase dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository to classify spam. This data is already parsed down from email to features.

## 4. Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data). Will you be doing unsupervised vs supervised methods? What specific methods within unsupervised and supervised will help you answer your questions from point #3?

We will be using supervised models, mainly different classification models like:

* Naive Bayes
* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest Classifier

These classification methods will help us to classify the data into spam and not-spam, based on given features.
