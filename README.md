## 1. Project title. 

Household Income Prediction based on US Demographic data

## 2. What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?

US Census: https://www.census.gov/data.html

## 3. Description of the problem you’ll solve. 

Every ten years, the US government conducts a nationwide survey to better understand the population's current distribution. The Census Bureau updates the estimates about once a year. This information is useful for local governments in making economic and development decisions such as where to locate schools, hospitals, and stores, among other things.

## 4. Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data). Will you be doing unsupervised vs supervised methods? What specific methods within unsupervised and supervised will help you answer your questions from point #3?

We will be performing supervised methods by training different classification models like:
SVM
Decision Trees 
Random Forest Classifier
