## 1. Project title. 

Predicting Onset of diabetes

## 2. What data you’ll use and where you’ll get it?

Pima Indians Diabetes Dataset: https://www.openml.org/search?type=data&sort=runs&status=active&id=37

## 3. Description of the problem you’ll solve. 

"Diabetes is a disease that develops when your blood glucose, commonly known as blood sugar, is too high," according to the National Institutes of Health. Your main source of energy is blood glucose, which comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone produced by the pancreas, aids glucose absorption into cells for use as energy. Sometimes your body doesn't produce enough — or any — insulin, or it doesn't use it properly. Glucose remains in your circulation and does not reach your cells as a result. Having too much glucose in your blood might lead to health issues over time. Although there is no cure for diabetes, you may take efforts to manage it and stay healthy.

Objective: To diagnose whether a patient has diabetes using diagnostic metrics included in the dataset.

## 4. Potential methods you will consider apply (these can change as you play with the data). Will you be doing unsupervised vs supervised methods? What specific methods within unsupervised and supervised will help you answer your questions from point #3?

We will be using supervised models, mainly different classification models like:

* Naive Bayes
* KNN
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machines
* Decision Trees
* Random Forest Classifier

These classification methods will help us to classify whether or not a patient has diabetes based on given features.
